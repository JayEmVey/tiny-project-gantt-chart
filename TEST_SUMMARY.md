### 5. Package Scripts

Added to [package.json](package.json):
```json
"test": "playwright test",
"test:ui": "playwright test --ui",
"test:headed": "playwright test --headed",
"test:chromium": "playwright test --project=chromium",
"test:firefox": "playwright test --project=firefox",
"test:webkit": "playwright test --project=webkit",
"test:functional": "playwright test tests/functional.spec.ts",
"test:ux": "playwright test tests/ux.spec.ts",
"test:performance": "playwright test tests/performance.spec.ts",
"test:accessibility": "playwright test tests/accessibility.spec.ts",
"test:report": "playwright show-report"
```

## How to Run Tests

### From Terminal (Simplest)

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in interactive UI mode (recommended)
npm run test:ui

# Run tests and see the browser
npm run test:headed

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:functional
npm run test:ux
npm run test:performance
npm run test:accessibility

# Run on specific browser
npm run test:chromium
npm run test:firefox
npm run test:webkit

# View test report
npm run test:report
```

### Step-by-Step Example

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run tests in UI mode**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:ui
   ```

3. **Or run all tests in terminal**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **View the report**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:report
   ```

## CI/CD Ready

The test suite is configured to run automatically in CI environments:
- Headless mode
- Automatic retries
- HTML/JSON reports
- Screenshots on failure
- Works with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the tests** to verify everything works:
   ```bash
   npm run test:ui
   ```

2. **Review the test reports** to see detailed results

3. **Customize tests** to match your specific features

4. **Integrate with CI/CD** for automated testing

5. **Add more tests** as you develop new features
